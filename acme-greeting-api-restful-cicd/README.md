## Testing

This project has tests : Unit + Integration

Execute with IDE or Maven


## Deploy

Spring Boot

### Deploy Method 1

1. Execute Application.java File


### Deploy Method 2

1. Execute the following command

```bash
mvn package 
```

Package the application in a single/fat JAR file (executable JAR + All dependencies + Embedded Servlet Container if its a web applications)

To run the jar file use the following command 

```bash
java -jar target/acme-greeting-api-restful-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Use default environment -> dev


### Deploy Method 3 : Environment

1. Execute the following command

Use Spring profiles with Maven Profiles -> Special Integration

* spring.profiles.active=@spring.profiles.active@
* enable resource filtering


In this case define : "dev", "uat" and "prod"

```bash
mvn package -Pprod
```
Package the application in a single/fat JAR file (executable JAR + All dependencies + Embedded Servlet Container if its a web applications)

To run the jar file use the following command
